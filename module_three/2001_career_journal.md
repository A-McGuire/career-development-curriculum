#### Overview
* **What it is.** The journal will help guide you through the process of discovering who you are as a new developer and how that translates into your career goals.  It’s a way to check in with yourself through self-reflection, prompts, and questions, organize your targeted job search, and remember who you met as you build a professional network.   
* **Make it your own.** Add questions and areas to reflect on each week. Just don’t forget to share all of your successes and achievements along the way! 
* **Ongoing progress checks.** Throughout the module, you'll respond to the other prompts and update your progress in your document during professional development workshops and set aside work time. 
* **Module Expectations.** A completed career journal is required for successfully passing Module 3. The career development team will be assessing your progress throughout the module, and you will submit it for final review in week 6. You will also include highlights from your progress in your end of module portfolio presentation.

### Mod 3 Week 4: Refining Your Strategy <a name="week-4"></a>
Prepare for Job Shadow: AEIOU
* Activities: what questions do you have about the activities that a software developer does on a daily basis?  
* Environment: what questions do you have about the overall environment and culture of this workplace?
* Interactions: what questions do you have about the team at this company? What do you hope to see in your interactions during the shadow?
* Objects: what questions do you have about the code or the product? 
* Users: what questions do you have about how the company interacts with their users? 

After the Job Shadow, reflect on the same questions; what are your takeaways from the shadow? Ho
* Activities: what was engaging to the person/people you shadowed?
* Environment: what did you notice about how they talked about the culture and environment of this company?
* Interactions: what did you notice about your interactions with this person/people?
* Objects: what did you learn about their approach to code and/or product development?
* Users: what did you learn about their approach to their users? 
* What are your main takeaways from the shadow? How will you use this information to help you with your job search strategy? 

Mind Maps:
* 1. **Engagement.** Go back to your reflections on when you're engaged in your work at Turing. Pull out an idea that resonates with you most (e.g., "Talking through a problem with a partner," "The moment when I solve a problem that I previously didn't know how to do," "Setting up a successful project management process for my team") and break that idea down into parts and make a list of how you can search for these engaging activities in jobs and companies you're looking at.
* 2. **Energy.** Go back to your reflections on when you're most energized in your work at Turing. Pull out an idea that resonates with you most and break that idea down into parts and make a list of how you can search for these engaging activities in jobs and companies you're looking at.
* 3. **Flow.** When have you had an experience recently in which you were in a state of flow? You can also think about this as "joy" or "play." Pull out an idea that resonates with you most and break that idea down into parts and make a list of how you can search for these engaging activities in jobs and companies you're looking at.

Prototype your next steps: what do these mind maps tell you about what's important to you as a software developer? How could you use this information to adjust how you're looking for jobs? 

Outreach & Networking Plan:  
* What company are you exploring this week? Who will you contact from that company? Why that person? How will you contact them? How will you follow up? 

Execute your plan:
* Reach out to your contact THIS WEEK. If possible, reach out to more than one person OR find a meetup to attend also. What happened? What did you learn about the company? What other next steps should you take for pursuing this company? Be sure to update this in Huntr.

### Mod 3 Week 5: Interview Prep <a name="week-5"></a>
1. Reflect on the module:
What have you accomplished this module (do you know what you’re looking for?) What have you learned? Do you need to change anything about your approach? Where are you stuck (have you not been able to follow through on outreach? Is your resume not finished?)

2. Getting unstuck with new strategies:
* What new things will you try? What will you do differently in your strategy?
* When will you have your resume completed? When will you have your portfolio updated on the Turing site? As you plan out your schedule for the week, think of how you'll hold yourself accountable to these goals. 

3. Interview Prep:
* Pick a successful project and write about it with the STAR method:
* Write about a time you failed and what you learned from that experience:
* Write about how you've approached working with a team using a specific example: 
* What other stories will you prepare to share?
* Do some research into your top companies' tech stacks; what do you already know? What can you compare to your own learning? What do you need to learn more about?
* Using this [interview prep resource doc](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum-site/blob/master/resources/interview_prep_resources.md), pick out at least 3 resources you will use to prepare for interviews as well as 3 behavioral questions you could practice:
