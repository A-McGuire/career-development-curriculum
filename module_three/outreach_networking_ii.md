#### Objectives
* Understand the purpose of outreach within your job search 
* Identify what’s not working in your outreach strategy
* Develop a new outreach strategy using Do’s and Don’ts from alumni experiences

### Opening
Last mod, we discussed utilizing outreach for research to use in your job search by setting up meetings with warm outreach contacts. Now we'll start to discuss how to use the same outreach principles and apply them to reaching out to people at the companies with open positions that you want. 

#### Whole Group Share Out
* Who executed their outreach plan from last mod? Share out results
* Who didn't? Why not -- what held you back?

### Review & Strategy
Our strategy for this again is to define:

* The Why
* The Who
* The What

#### The Why
Now that you're researching companies and positions, why reach out to someone from that company?

* Research 
  * Incorporate into your cover letter and interviews
* Connecting with a person
  * Building relationships
  * Exchanging information (mutual benefits)
  * Expanding both of your networks
* Become a referral candidate

#### The Who
Who should you reach out to from a company?

* Any warm contacts
* Software developers
  * Juniors vs. seniors
  * Engineering managers
* Recruiters
* Where do you find them?
  * Company page
  * LinkedIn

#### The What
Start with Research

Then, what do you say in your message?

* Introduction (who are you?)
* Purpose/Connection (why are you reaching out?)
* Specifics (what do you know about the contact? What do you know about the company?)
* Questions (what do you want to know?)

#### How to Send the Message: Email vs. LinkedIn
Whenever possible, find your contact's email (or use Slack if they're in the Turing network!). Why? Unless you're actively job searching or actively hiring, people may not be checking their LinkedIn regularly and might miss your message. Also, LinkedIn messages have a limited number of characters you can use. Instead try some of the following tools to find your contact's email:

* Tools for finding emails:
  * [Email Hunter](https://emailhunter.co/)
  * [Find That Lead](https://findthatlead.com/)
  * [Find That Email](https://findthat.email/)
  * [MatterMark](https://mattermark.com/)
  * [Skrapp.io](https://www.skrapp.io/)
  * [Quickmail.io](https://quickmail.io/)
  * [Snov.io](https://snov.io/)
  * [Go Pin Leads](https://www.gopinleads.com/)
  * GitHub
  * Personal website 

### Practice the Strategy
#### We Do
Using an example from the group, let's walk through this strategy together

#### You Do
For your practice, there are 2 options:

1. Using a real position and company that you're 



2. Or, if you don't yet have a real life company and position that you're interested in yet, practice the skill with this option:
* Create a list of your 3 top dream companies
* Find 2 people from each of those companies
* Start some research 
* 

### Pair & Share
Pair up with a partner to share the research and discuss

### Closing
Share out takeaways and discuss the ins and outs with 

Coffee Meetings
