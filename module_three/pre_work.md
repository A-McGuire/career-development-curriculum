# Professional Development Intermission Work for Mod 3

## Objective #1: Create your career journal

* As you start Module 3 at Turing, professional development will be focused on creating and implementing strategies for you to have a successful job search. To that end, you will be creating a career journal to complete progress towards the Mod 3 benchmarks, and you'll share this journal with the career development team so that we know how to best support you. You will continue to use this career journal in Mod 4.
    * What is a career journal? Check out [this blog post](https://www.themuse.com/advice/6-ways-keeping-a-journal-can-help-your-career) to see why this is a helpful tool. 
* Follow the directions [here to create and complete the first phase of your career journal.](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_three/2001_career_journal.md) 

#### How You'll Use Your Career Journal Throughout the Module
* Throughout the module, you'll respond to the other prompts and update your progress in your document during professional development workshops and set aside work time. 
* A completed career journal is required for successfully passing Module 3. The career development team will be assessing your progress throughout the module, and you will submit it for final review in week 6. You will also include highlights from your progress in your end of module portfolio presentation. 

## Objective #2: Complete the Following Survey

* After you have completed your career journal set-up and responded to the Intermission Work Prompts, please fill out this quick survey and submit the link to your journal by EOD Saturday 5/2.
