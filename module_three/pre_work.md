# Professional Development Intermission Work for Mod 3

## Objective #1: Create your career journal

* As you start Module 3 at Turing, professional development will be focused on creating and implementing strategies for you to have a successful job search. To that end, you will be creating a career journal to complete progress towards the Mod 3 benchmarks, and you'll share this journal with the career development team so that we know how to best support you. You will continue to use this career journal in Mod 4.
* Follow the directions [here to create and complete the first phase of your career journal.](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_three/2001_career_journal.md) 

#### How You'll Use Your Career Journal Throughout the Module
* **What it is.** The journal will help guide you through the process of discovering who you are as a new developer and how that translates into your career goals.  It’s a way to check in with yourself through self-reflection, prompts, and questions, organize your targeted job search, and remember who you met as you build a professional network.   
* **Make it your own.** Add questions and areas to reflect on each week. Just don’t forget to share all of your successes and achievements along the way! 
* **Ongoing progress checks.** Throughout the module, you'll respond to the other prompts and update your progress in your document during professional development workshops and set aside work time. 
* **Module Expectations.** A completed career journal is required for successfully passing Module 3. The career development team will be assessing your progress throughout the module, and you will submit it for final review in week 6. You will also include highlights from your progress in your end of module portfolio presentation. 

## Objective #2: Complete the Following Survey

* After you have completed your career journal set-up and responded to the Intermission Work Prompts, [please fill out this survey](https://forms.gle/iXWbjg8fAz6AN3aSA) and submit the link to your journal by EOD Saturday 5/2.
