### Setting New Norms
Welcome to Module 4. It's easy to feel burnt out at this point in the program; however, this module is your peak. It's the opportunity to refine your technical and professional skills for the job search. The best way to do that is to support each other through this module as a cohesive cohort.

You’ve worked together for 3 mods already, and you’ve set norms for how to work together. Now you’re transitioning into not only working together but preparing for your careers post-Turing. To set us up for success this module, let's start with setting some new norms on how we can best work and support each other. 

#### Whole Group Discussion
Cold call 3 people to answer one of each of these questions:

* What does your cohort do well? How do you know? 
* How would you describe the morale of your cohort? What contributes to that?
* How would you describe your cohort's successes so far? What contributes to that?

Consider your cohort's strengths and how you can capitalize on them this module. 

#### Individual Reflections
Reflect on these questions in your journals to prepare for discussions with your cohorts:

* 

#### Cohort Discussions
Divide the room down the middle with BE on one side and FE on the other (note: if cohorts are especially large, this could be done in small groups or in each of the cohort's respective classrooms before coming back to Clarke to share out). Each cohort will have a chart paper to contribute group norms to, which must include these particular sections: 

* How can you do your best work this module?
* What role do you each want to take within the cohort to ensure that everyone can do their best work?
* 

One person should be the notetaker, and everyone should be given an opportunity to participate. 

### Share Out
* One representative from each group will share out the cohort's norms as well as additional volunteers to share about their individual roles in the cohort. 

Now that we know our cohort norms for Mod 4, let's discuss options for Mod 4 PD.

### Mod 4 PD Options
While you will still receive a few whole group PD sessions, in weeks 3-5, you can choose to participate in small group job search mentorship with a staff member. 

Please read over this [1-pager](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EsPZtNaDBTNvFUcoVwGVYPLGg7wQtNqJUKix0XS88Xs/edit?usp=sharing) with information on what this means as well as the [application requirements for job search mentorship](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/job_search_mentorship_application.md). Discuss questions from the whole group.

### Cover Letter Review
Review cover letter norms

#### Individual Review
Read through your cover letter and highlight specific questions you have for the group

#### Small Group Sharing
Break out into groups of 3-4 people and in a group DM, send your cover letter drafts. 

More prompting questions; force group members to give feedback first; have them do more peer review of materials (bring some prompting questions);
Assign roles to the students (person 1 is in charge of critiquing tone; person 2 is in charge of sentence structure; ....)
Person to the right does the checklist, other person takes notes, etc.
Small Group/Peer review
