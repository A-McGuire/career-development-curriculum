## Opening: The Big Picture
### Sit in your Coaching Groups

### Objectives
* Understand the scope and sequence of Module 4 Professional Development and what support looks like this module
* Discover the use and importance of M4 PD peer groups & coaches
* Utilize strategies for managing time for the job search during module
* Give and receive feedback on cover letter drafts

### Module 4 Professional Development Scope & Sequence

### Looking Ahead
Here is the PD layout of week-by-week in Module 4:

You'll be expected to:

## The Job Search Requires...
* Discipline
* Hustle
* Skill

You already have the skill:
* Technical skills
* Professional Development tools

In 5 minutes within your groups:
* Brainstorm all the steps you should take/tools you should use in a successful job search as a junior developer

So, how do you develop the discipline and the hustle for the job search?

1. Create your tools:
  * Establish a calendar
  * Block out time throughout each week
  * Depending on your timeline for needing a job, your calendar will look different!

2. Stay accountable:
  * Share this with your coach and group
  * Projects: make this part of your DTR
  * What problems do you anticipate running into here?

3. Outline your time:
  * What will you actually do during the time youâ€™ve set aside?
  * Approach this like you would a project: 
    * Break into tasks
    * Trello, Waffle, etc.
    * Use Huntr!

## You Do
Build out your calendar for the module that will balance the job search and the module expectations. 

## Group Discussions
* Coach introductions
* Expectation-setting
* Accountability 
  * Share calendars
  * What can you help the group with?

## Cover Letter Reviews
Now that you've introduced yourselves, it's time to dive into the cover letters you've brought with you. This cover letter review will take place in your PD groups and follow this format:

### Individual Review
Students: Take 5 minutes to go through the [Cover Letter Checklist](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/cover_letter_checklist.md) and reread the cover letter to decide what feedback will be most valuable during the review. To figure out what feedback will be most valuable for you, think about these questions:
   * What are you not sure about?
   * What would you like to do differently but you don't know how?

### Group Feedback
Now going around the group, each person will:
   * Share a brief overview of the company and position for which they're applying; share the link to the position if able
   * Share what kind of feedback they're most interested in
   * Read the cover letter out loud to the group
Group and Coach will give feedback using these questions:
   * What's your snap impression?
   * What's most memorable?
   * What's repetitive? 
   * What makes this person a good fit for the position?
   * What do you have questions about?
Each person should get about 10 minutes for their feedback

### Revision Time
Using the feedback you received, revise your letter and decide on next steps for this application:

* Who will you reach out to from the company? Or how will you do research to figure out the right person to reach out to?
* What other pieces need to be completed for this application?
* Do you need any other feedback/support before submitting this application?
* By what exact date/time will you submit this application?

### Sharing Takeaways
* What are your next steps for this application?
* When will you submit this application?
