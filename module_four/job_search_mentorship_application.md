# Application for Job Search Mentorship Program
In order to apply for the Mod 4 Job Search Mentorship Program, submit a private gist containing information for Sections I & II [here](https://forms.gle/oeRiiGGg9naMeqPV6) by 4pm on Wednesday of Week 2.

## Section I: Calendar
To balance your job search with your Mod 4 workload, structuring your time well is key. Using a program like Google Calendar, build out a calendar for Week 3 to show how you will spend time outside of class on your job search. Your job search timeboxing should be as specific as you can make it. 

#### How To Do This:
Build a sustainable routine:
  * What could a typical week look like for you?
  * When do you work best during the day? 
  * What is a realistic way to spend your time? (Don't overcommit yourself; consider blocking out 1 hour a day)
  * What will you work on during that time?
  
**What to Submit:**
* Include a screenshot of your Week 3 calendar in your gist by following [these directions](https://gist.github.com/kannankumar/4c613cac6d9db896062a16e1cc57d3e5)
* This screenshot should have all of your job search time broken down into specific tasks (i.e., find posting, write outreach email, write cover letter, etc.)
