## Cover Letter Reviews
Now that you've introduced yourselves, it's time to dive into the cover letters you've brought with you. This cover letter review will take place in your PD groups and follow this format:

### Individual Review
Students: Take 5 minutes to go through the [Cover Letter Checklist](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/cover_letter_checklist.md) and reread the cover letter to decide what feedback will be most valuable during the review. To figure out what feedback will be most valuable for you, think about these questions:
   * What are you not sure about?
   * What would you like to do differently but you don't know how?

### Group Feedback
Now going around the group, each person will:
   * Share a brief overview of the company and position for which they're applying; share the link to the position if able
   * Share what kind of feedback they're most interested in
   * Read the cover letter out loud to the group
Group and Coach will give feedback using these questions:
   * What's your snap impression?
   * What's most memorable?
   * What's repetitive? 
   * What makes this person a good fit for the position?
   * What do you have questions about?
Each person should get about 10 minutes for their feedback

### Revision Time
Using the feedback you received, revise your letter and decide on next steps for this application:

* Who will you reach out to from the company? Or how will you do research to figure out the right person to reach out to?
* What other pieces need to be completed for this application?
* Do you need any other feedback/support before submitting this application?
* By what exact date/time will you submit this application?

### Sharing Takeaways
* What are your next steps for this application?
* When will you submit this application?
