### Intro to Outreach
What is the purpose of outreach at this stage in your job search?

One word: research

### Research: So what do you want to learn?

* Start with your Flower Exercise findings
   * What 

### Networking
Who do you reach out to? How will you do it?

#### Your Network


### Writing the Message
Once you decide who you'll reach out to, it's time to figure out your message. How? Start with researching your contact. 

Know who you're contacting:
* LinkedIn: Where have they worked?
* GitHub: What are they working on?
* Medium: What do they blog about?
* Twitter: What do they tweet about? 
* What else? 

#### Demo
Let's take 1-2 contacts and do some research as a group.

#### The Message
What should be included here?
    * Introduction: who are you?
    * Purpose: why are you reaching out?
    * Specifics to the contact: what do you know about them? How does it connect to your purpose?
    * Call to Action: what are the next steps here?

What should NOT be included here? (All from Alumni)
* Asking for a reference or job
* Unclear purpose
* Generic message/unclear specifics about them as a person. This includes using a template.
* Mentioning multiple people you're reaching out to

#### What Does This Look Like?
Let's craft a message to one of our contacts that we researched together. 

#### How to Send the Message: Email vs. LinkedIn
Whenever possible, find your contact's email (or use Slack if they're in the Turing network!). Why? Unless you're actively job searching or actively hiring, people may not be checking their LinkedIn regularly and might miss your message. Also, LinkedIn messages have a limited number of characters you can use. Instead try some of the following tools to find your contact's email:

* Tools for finding emails:
  * [Email Hunter](https://emailhunter.co/)
  * [Find That Lead](https://findthatlead.com/)
  * [Find That Email](https://findthat.email/)
  * [MatterMark](https://mattermark.com/)
  * [Skrapp.io](https://www.skrapp.io/)
  * [Quickmail.io](https://quickmail.io/)
  * GitHub
  * Personal website

* What are you working on next as you finalize your outreach and networking plan?
* What are you taking away from this session?
