### Opening
Using a fist to five, how was that practice for you? What was difficult about it?

Let's start by thinking about this question: *how well do you know yourself?*

That question is the essence of the non-technical interview. To ace this part of the interview, you want to bring a level of self-awareness to the process so that you can confidently answer any question asked of you. 

### Interview Prep Tips
**1. Answer the whole question**
Pay attention to what the question is asking, and make sure that you're 


**2. Keep the acronym [STAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation,_task,_action,_result) in mind:**

* **Situation:** The interviewer wants you to present a recent challenge and situation in which you found yourself.
* **Task:** What were you required to achieve? The interviewer will be looking to see what you were trying to achieve from the situation. Some performance development methods use “Target” rather than “Task”. Job interview candidates who describe a “Target” they set themselves instead of an externally imposed “Task” emphasize their own intrinsic motivation to perform and to develop their performance.
* **Action:** What did you do? The interviewer will be looking for information on what you did, why you did it, and what the alternatives were.
* **Results:** What was the outcome of your actions? What did you achieve through your actions and did you meet your objectives? What did you learn from this experience and have you used this learning since?

### Group Practice
Get into groups of 3-4 for more practice. Start by spending 5 minutes reflecting on more of these questions in your journal and then take turns answering the questions and providing feedback for each other.

* Why do you want to be a software developer?
* What are your strengths as a developer? 
* Describe a successful project that you worked on. What made it a success?
* When have you had to deal with failure? What did you do?
* What is your approach to working on a team?
* What is an area of growth for you?

### Closing
* What are your takeaways from today's practice? 
* What next steps will you take to prepare for next module's mock interviews?
