* Intro to Social Identity Mapping (15 mins)
* Social Identity Mapping Activity (8 mins)
* Pomodoro (5 mins)
* 

### Opening Activity
In your journal, draw a line down the page. On the left side, write down all your strengths. On the right side, write down all the strengths/qualities of a software developer. Circle or put a star next to the ones that overlap.

### The Why: Coming Full Circle
Throughout this module, we've been talking about our strengths as a way to build more awareness of how we work, communicate, and lead. This session serves as a culmination of that work as we begin to connect that understanding to continue to build relationships with each other and begin to tell a cohesive professional story for our new careers.

Today, we'll do a deeper dive into our strengths, values, and social identities.

#### Objectives
* 

### Activity #1: Social Identity Mapping
*This activity comes from the Center for Creative Leadership*

Question to the group: When you think of the words "culture fit," what comes to mind?

This phrase can cause many organizations to form around people who share a common culture and set of values. This makes sense -- we seek out the people who are most like us. However, research shows that organizations are more successful when they incorporate groups of people with very different histories, perspectives, values, and cultures. And more and more organizations are moving towards embracing that idea of diversity. 

Why does this matter to you? 
1. You each bring your own specific culture and set of values to this industry. That is something to be celebrated as you carve out your own niche in the tech industry.
2. By understanding and articulating your culture and values, you are able to relate to others better, work with them more successfully, and demonstrate the growth you achieve through working with others who are both similar and different to you.

So how do we do that? By looking at our **social identities** more closely.

**Social identity** uses parts of a person’s identity to categorize them into groups. All of us are members of multiple groups. Many of us compare the groups we belong to with other groups, typically thinking more highly of our own.

Your social identity is a combination of three broad components: 
* Given: consisting of the conditions that are outside of your control such as birthplace, gender, certain
family roles or physical characteristics
* Chosen: includes the characteristics that you choose such as occupation, hobbies and political affiliation
* Core: made up of the attributes that make you unique as an individual such as behaviors, values, skills, and items from your
given and chosen categories

**I Do:** Facilitator demonstrates how to fill out a social identity map and discusses their own map

How can we apply these social identity maps to articulating who we are more effectively? Let's look at this example from Josh Mejia, Back End Instructor:

```I grew up in a blue collar town within a family that, while we were close and valued each other, didn't focus much on education. We were near the poverty line for a good portion of my childhood and relied on things such as Section 8, food stamps, and free lunch. Technology was not a passion of mine. In fact, I was convinced I didn't want to work with computers or spend all day sitting at a desk. It took me years to give software a chance. I was playing music with a couple friends who were software engineers and that encouraged me to look into it as a career path. I declined their nudges and continued working blue collar jobs for the first 10 years of my adult life. After growing tired of the options in front of me, I decided to take their advice and started teaching myself HTML and CSS. One of my friends was working with Ruby on Rails, and he recommended I dive a little deeper.```

**Whole Group Discussion:**
* What did you learn about Josh here?
* What are some ways that he discusses his social identity? 
* What do you connect with from what he shared?

Some takeaways here:
* Even though our social identities could cause us to stick with people who are most like us, by sharing our social identities, we begin to see the ways in which our social identities overlap with people who on the surface seem unlike us.
* Understanding our social identities allows us to identify the ways in which we already feel like we're a part of the tech industry, identify the ways we don't *yet* feel that we're a part of the tech industry, and begin to build bridges to incorporate the latter even more.

#### You Do
Using the handout, create your own social identity map: 

1. In the outer ring, write words that describe your given identity: attributes that you had no choice about such as your nationality, age, gender, physical characteristics, certain family roles, possibly religion.
2. In the next ring, list aspects of your chosen identity. Consider including your occupation, hobbies, political affiliation, where you live, certain family roles, possibly religion. Examples are cyclist, mother, engineer, expatriate, college graduate, wife, leader, New Yorker, Buddhist.
3. In the center, write your core attributes—traits, behaviors, beliefs, values, characteristics, and skills that you think make you unique as an individual. Select things that are enduring and key to who you. For example, you may see yourself as funny, artistic, kind, conservative, creative, impatient, musical, family focused, assertive.
4. After you complete your map:
  * Underline the items that are important to you. These are likely to be the terms you would use to describe yourself.
  * Put a plus sign (+) beside the items that you believe contribute to your ability to be an effective software developer.
  * Put a minus sign (-) beside the items that you believe detract from your ability to be an effective software developer.
  * Put a question mark (?) beside the items that may vary in how they affect your abilities as a software developer,
depending on context. 

### Turn & Talk

### Activity #2: Strengths & Values 



Let's look at these examples from other staff members:

* **Amy Holt, Back End Instructor:** "I still struggle every day! One thing I learned about myself and my learning style while at Turing is that it's really important I understand the inner-workings of things before I feel ok with implementing them. At first, I just thought I was a slow learner. Connecting my 'speed' in picking up concepts to my need for a deeper understanding helped me be a little more kind with myself. When I'm really discouraged, I try to step back and remind myself of how far I've come and acknowledge that it is always possible to 'do the thing'. "

* **Leta Keane, Front End Instructor:** "I constantly struggle with learning to code! Coding has never been easy for me, never been intuitive, never been anything other than a very conscious, very intentional PROCESS. I had to learn that just because coding is not intuitive for me, it doesn't mean that I can't or shouldn't code. It doesn't mean that I am a weak developer. Instead, I make use of my very strong skills of communication, organization, planning, and logic to work through problems methodically and collaboratively. I am driven by logic that is tempered by empathy. People should have the resources and understanding they need to make informed decisions for themselves and the safety to grow and thrive. I like to share my experiences and knowledge with the people around me, including the times I've messed up, because examples and commiseration are powerful in combatting imposter syndrome and doubt."

* **Jeff Casimir, Executive Director:** "I remember really struggling when I first started learning about functional programming. At that point I had been writing code for 15 years. I started to see that the anxiety about not 'getting it' was actually preventing me from getting it. When I don't understand what I'm doing I like to copy, modify, create. I take something that I know works, from the web or a book or whatever, and just type that out and make it run. Then I start tweaking things. What if I rearrange two lines, change some numbers or values, that kind of thing. I think of it as 'pulling on' the code, seeing how it flexes and changes. Then I delete a chunk of the code and try to write it myself. I think one of my strengths in life and programming is a willingness to experiment. I prefer to move quickly and learn, even if it means making mistakes, rather than sitting and planning. When you're planning you're working with the information you have right now. When you experiment you have the opportunity to gain new perspective/data."

**Discussion**:


**I Do:** Facilitator demonstrates how to complete the strengths and values activity. 

#### You Do
You have 2 handouts:
* A handout with 4 quadrants labeled with *Always Valued, Often Valued, Sometimes Valued,* and *Seldom Valued* 
* You get a stack of cards, each with a quality. Each person places each card in the quadrant they feel it belongs. Then you pick the top 5 and bottom 5. Then, for the top 5 values we assessed how we are currently experiencing that (some people did a :heavy_check_mark:-, :heavy_check_mark: , :heavy_check_mark: +, some did a scale of 1-5) and we talked about why we felt we were getting what we needed of it and what we felt was missing.

### Small Group Discussions
Form groups of 3-4 people to discuss the following questions:

* Why did you come to Turing?
* Why will you succeed at Turing?
* What helps you overcome challenges at Turing? 
* 

When you are building a relationship, what do you want to know about the other person? What
do you notice first? Are you attracted to certain characteristics in others?


* What assumptions do you make about other people based on their social identity?



* What assumptions do you think other people make about you based on your social identity?

5. If you were to see the identity maps of other people in your community coalition, how much do
you think you would have in common with them?


6. What are the areas that would probably be different?

7. How does what I learn relate to how I work across boundaries?
