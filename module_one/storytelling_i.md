### Session Structure

Length: 85 mins

* 

### Opening Activity
In your journal, draw a line down the page. On the left side, write down all your strengths. On the right side, write down all the strengths/qualities of a software developer. Which ones overlap? 

### The Why: Coming Full Circle
At the beginning of this module, we started by talking about your strengths as a way to build more awareness of how we work, communicate, and lead. This session serves as a culmination of that work as we begin to connect that understanding to continue to build relationships with each other and begin to tell a cohesive professional story for our new careers.

Today, we'll do a deeper dive into our strengths, values, and social identities.

#### Objectives

### Activity #1: Social Identity Mapping
*This activity comes from the Center for Creative Leadership*

REVISE: In the past, leaders worked in organizations in which most people shared a common culture and
set of values. Today, leaders must bring together groups of people with very different histories,
perspectives, values, and cultures. Leaders today need an awareness of social identity, their own and
that of others.
Social identity uses parts of a person’s identity to categorize them into groups. All of us are members
of multiple groups. Many of us compare the groups we belong to with other groups, typically thinking
more highly of our own.
Your social identity is a combination of three broad components: given, chosen, and core. Your given
identity consists of the conditions that are outside of your control such as birthplace, gender, certain
family roles or physical characteristics. Your chosen identity includes the characteristics that you
choose such as occupation, hobbies and political affiliation. Your core identity is made up of the
attributes that make you unique as an individual such as behaviors, values, skills, and items from your
given and chosen category.

Let's look at this story from Josh Mejia, Back End Instructor:

```I grew up in a blue collar town within a family that, while we were close and valued each other, didn't focus much on education. We were near the poverty line for a good portion of my childhood and relied on things such as Section 8, food stamps, and free lunch. Technology was not a passion of mine. In fact, I was convinced I didn't want to work with computers or spend all day sitting at a desk. It took me years to give software a chance. I was playing music with a couple friends who were software engineers and that encouraged me to look into it as a career path. I declined their nudges and continued working blue collar jobs for the first 10 years of my adult life. After growing tired of the options in front of me, I decided to take their advice and started teaching myself HTML and CSS. One of my friends was working with Ruby on Rails, and he recommended I dive a little deeper.```

* What did you learn about Josh here?
* What do you connect with from what he shared?

**I Do:** Facilitator discusses their own map

#### You Do
Using the handout, create your own social identity map: 

1. In the outer ring, write words that describe your given identity: attributes that you had no
choice about such as your nationality, age, gender, physical characteristics, certain family roles,
possibly religion.
2. In the next ring, list aspects of your chosen identity. Consider including your occupation,
hobbies, political affiliation, where you live, certain family roles, possibly religion. Examples are
cyclist, mother, engineer, expatriate, college graduate, wife, leader, New Yorker, Buddhist.
3. In the center, write your core attributes—traits, behaviors, beliefs, values, characteristics, and
skills that you think make you unique as an individual. Select things that are enduring and key
to who you. For example, you may see yourself as funny, artistic, kind, conservative, creative,
impatient, musical, family focused, assertive.
4. After you complete your map:
  * Underline the items that are important to you. These are likely to be the terms you would use to
describe yourself.
  * Put a plus sign (+) beside the items that you believe contribute to your ability to lead effectively.
  * Put a minus sign (-) beside the items that you believe detract from your ability to lead effectively.
  * Put a question mark (?) beside the items that may vary in how they affect your leadership ability,
depending on context. 

### Reflection/Turn & Talk....

### Activity #2: Strengths & Values 
Blurb on background/why

**I Do:** Facilitator demonstrates 

#### You Do
You have 2 handouts:
* A handout with 4 quadrants labeled with *Always Valued, Often Valued, Sometimes Valued,* and *Seldom Valued* 
* You get a stack of cards, each with a quality. Each person places each card in the quadrant they feel it belongs. Then you pick the top 5 and bottom 5. Then, for the top 5 values we assessed how we are currently experiencing that (some people did a :heavy_check_mark:-, :heavy_check_mark: , :heavy_check_mark: +, some did a scale of 1-5) and we talked about why we felt we were getting what we needed of it and what we felt was missing.

### Small Group Discussions
Form groups of 3-4 people to discuss the following questions:

* Why did you come to Turing?
* Why will you succeed at Turing?
* What helps you overcome challenges at Turing? 

When you are building a relationship, what do you want to know about the other person? What
do you notice first? Are you attracted to certain characteristics in others?

* Then, make a social identity map with the other people on your team. Identify what you all have in common and what is unique to each of you. 


* What assumptions do you make about other people based on their social identity?


3. If someone else were mapping your identity, what do you think they would notice first? What
would be most relevant to them? Why?


* What assumptions do you think other people make about you based on your social identity?

5. If you were to see the identity maps of other people in your community coalition, how much do
you think you would have in common with them?


6. What are the areas that would probably be different?

7. How does what I learn relate to how I work across boundaries?

### Whole Group Debrief/Synthesis

### Closing Activity: Exit Ticket
Using what you've learned about yourself today, write a job description for yourself as a software developer, emphasizing your strengths, values, and social identity as inspiration. You'll submit this job description [here]( by Monday of Week 6 at 9am.
