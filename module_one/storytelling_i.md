#### The Why: Why Telling Your Story is Important
Stories are how we connect with each other. From fairy tales to novels to movies to podcasts, stories provide a way for people to share their experiences with others, building empathy and awareness of our universal experiences.

Storytelling is our first step in the job search at Turing. You are a member of the software industry now, and as you start connecting with others in the industry, you need to be able to tell the story of your transition -- how did you get here? How do you uniquely make up a part of this industry? 

In this session and throughout your career development at Turing, we'll focus on how you can craft a compelling story to describe who you are, how you came to this industry, and where you see yourself going. This is a story that you'll tell employers, colleagues at networking events, and even your Turing community. This is the start of you being able to tell your story professionally and find the right match for your future career.

Let's start by thinking about stories. What do you love about stories? Emma Coats, a former story artist for Pixar, published [this post](http://storyshots.tumblr.com/post/25032057278/22-storybasics-ive-picked-up-in-my-time-at-pixar) with her 22 rules for storytelling. We're going to start with rule #10:

    Pull apart the stories you like. What you like in them is a part of you; 
    you’ve got to recognize it before you can use it.

**Turn & Talk:**

What stories stick with you and why? Think of a story that you love; maybe it's a story from childhood, maybe it's a book you just finished reading, or maybe it's a story that has been passed down through your family. Turn to the person next to you and take 2 minutes to retell that story, and then switch.

**Whole Group Debrief:**

Sharing from 1-2 people:

* What key details do you remember from your partner's story?
* How did your partner tell the story? 
* What made the story interesting?

This brings us to the elements that make up a good story -- what are they?

Possible answers: consistent theme, protagonist who faces and overcomes challenges, a journey of some kind, sequential plot that shows a beginning, middle, and end.

When it comes to character, what does it mean to be the hero of the story? What are the typical characteristics of a hero? 

**More Lessons from Pixar (and Joseph Campbell):**
Most stories follow the 3-Act Arc:
* Act I (Set-Up)
   * Call to adventure and accepts
   * Rules of the world are established
   * Inciting Incident
* Act II (Struggle)
   * Looking for ways to solve the problem
   * Learning what it will take to actually solve problem
   * Crisis/“Lowest of the low”
* Act III (Finale)
   * Show what’s been learned
   * Protagonist is changed

**Connection to You:**
These elements are present in your story as well. You are the main character, the hero, undergoing challenges, experiencing a journey, and revealing the narrative thread through your own theme.

There are 3 main questions to help us understand our own stories and our character arcs:
* Who are you?
* Why are you here?
* What's next?

### Examples from Staff
What do you think a software developer's story looks like? If we think they all look the same or look like people who have succeeded easily in this industry, it's time to redefine our heroes in the tech industry.

This bring us to 2 more rules from Emma Coats:

    What are the stakes? Give us reason to root for the character. What happens if they don’t succeed? Stack the odds against them.
    
    You admire a character for trying more than for their successes.

This is because we root for a character to overcome struggles and adversity. As the character in our own stories, we need to be able to access our vulnerabilities to authentically tell this part of our story -- *and our listeners will thank us for it because this is how they relate to us.* 

Let's here from some Turing staff:

* I grew up in a blue collar town within a family that, while we were close and valued each other, didn't focus much on education. We were near the poverty line for a good portion of my childhood and relied on things such as Section 8, food stamps, and free lunch. Technology was not a passion of mine. In fact, I was convinced I didn't want to work with computers or spend all day sitting at a desk. It took me years to give software a chance. I was playing music with a couple friends who were software engineers and that encouraged me to look into it as a career path. I declined their nudges and continued working blue collar jobs for the first 10 years of my adult life. After growing tired of the options in front of me, I decided to take their advice and started teaching myself HTML and CSS. One of my friends was working with Ruby on Rails, and he recommended I dive a little deeper.
                                                                            - Josh Mejia, Back End Instructor

**Whole Group Discussion Questions:**
* What do you connect with from this person's story and why?
* What did you learn about this person? How would you describe their character?
* What storytelling elements are present here? 
   * Do you want to know more? Why/Why not?
   * What do you think happens next?
* How could this story be used to connect with others when building personal and professional relationships?

#### Break-out Groups
Form groups of 3-4 people to discuss the following stories of struggle from staff members:

* **Amy Holt, Back End Instructor:** "I still struggle every day! One thing I learned about myself and my learning style while at Turing is that it's really important I understand the inner-workings of things before I feel ok with implementing them. At first, I just thought I was a slow learner. Connecting my 'speed' in picking up concepts to my need for a deeper understanding helped me be a little more kind with myself. When I'm really discouraged, I try to step back and remind myself of how far I've come and acknowledge that it is always possible to 'do the thing'. "

* **Leta Keane, Front End Instructor:** "I constantly struggle with learning to code! Coding has never been easy for me, never been intuitive, never been anything other than a very conscious, very intentional PROCESS. I had to learn that just because coding is not intuitive for me, it doesn't mean that I can't or shouldn't code. It doesn't mean that I am a weak developer. Instead, I make use of my very strong skills of communication, organization, planning, and logic to work through problems methodically and collaboratively. I am driven by logic that is tempered by empathy. People should have the resources and understanding they need to make informed decisions for themselves and the safety to grow and thrive. I like to share my experiences and knowledge with the people around me, including the times I've messed up, because examples and commiseration are powerful in combatting imposter syndrome and doubt."

* **Jeff Casimir, Executive Director:** "I remember really struggling when I first started learning about functional programming. At that point I had been writing code for 15 years. I started to see that the anxiety about not 'getting it' was actually preventing me from getting it. When I don't understand what I'm doing I like to copy, modify, create. I take something that I know works, from the web or a book or whatever, and just type that out and make it run. Then I start tweaking things. What if I rearrange two lines, change some numbers or values, that kind of thing. I think of it as 'pulling on' the code, seeing how it flexes and changes. Then I delete a chunk of the code and try to write it myself. I think one of my strengths in life and programming is a willingness to experiment. I prefer to move quickly and learn, even if it means making mistakes, rather than sitting and planning. When you're planning you're working with the information you have right now. When you experiment you have the opportunity to gain new perspective/data."

**Discussion Questions & Share Out:**
* What do you connect with from each story and why?
* What did you learn about this person? How would you describe their character?
* What patterns do you see across these stories?
* What storytelling elements are present here? 
   * Do you want to know more? Why/Why not?
   
#### Share Out
* What do these stories tell you about software developers?

### Pomodoro Break

### Choose Your Own Adventure: Developing Your Story
Using one (or more) of these storytelling tools, begin crafting your story:
* Life maps
* Story plot diagrams
* Vision statement
* Character study of yourself using your Pairin qualities
* Create a Decision Tree diagram to examine how you react to struggle

### Discussion #2 
Get into new groups of 4 to share your stories. Practice answering these questions:
* Who are you?
   * What is your journey/perspective/character?
* Why are you here? 
   * How are you learning and growing through the struggle?
* What’s next?
   * What’s your place in the tech industry?

*Share only what you’re comfortable sharing* 

### Closing: Whole Group Takeaways

* By sharing our stories with one another, how can we as a community build on our similarities and learn from our differences?
* What are particularly easy or difficult about sharing your stories with each other?
* How can talking about these 3 areas (who are we, why are we here, what's next) help us in our future careers? 

#### Next Steps
It's important to remember that each of these pieces of your story is a draft. You're continuing to grow and learn, and thus your story will change. But this is about starting with our first draft and getting better at refining it as we go through the program. 

Finish your [reflection](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/storytelling_reflection.md) using what you worked on in this session for your deliverable due Monday of Week 6. 

During the rest of your time here, consider ways that you can share your stories, the things that you value, and what you are hoping for in the upcoming weeks. The more connections you can make, the better you will be able to work together towards success.
